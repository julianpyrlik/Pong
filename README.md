## About The Project

This Python code implements a classic game of Pong. Two players control paddles on opposite sides of the screen, trying to hit a ball and prevent it from entering their goal. The first player to reach a score of 10 wins the game.

## Built With

Python
Turtle

### Installation

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., pong.py).

2. Install the required libraries (turtle comes pre-installed with Python).

3. Run the script from your terminal.

## Usage

- Use the "w" and "s" keys to move the left paddle up and down.

- Use the Up and Down arrow keys to move the right paddle up and down.

- The first player to reach 10 points wins!

## Roadmap
